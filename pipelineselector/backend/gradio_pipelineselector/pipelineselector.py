        Parameters:
            choices: A list of string options to choose from. An option can also be a tuple of the form (name, value), where name is the displayed name of the dropdown choice and value is the value to be passed to the function, or returned by the function.
            A value for this argument must be provided if `source` argument is set to `dropdown` (default value)
            value: default value(s) selected in dropdown. If None, no value is selected by default. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            pipeline: An instance of a pipeline to use. A value for this argument must be provied if `source` is set to `pipeline`.
            type: Type of value to be returned by component. "value" returns the string of the choice selected, "index" returns the index of the choice selected.
            multiselect: if True, multiple choices can be selected.
            allow_custom_value: If True, allows user to enter a custom value that is not in the list of choices.
            max_choices: maximum number of choices that can be selected. If None, no limit is enforced.
            filterable: If True, user will be able to type into the dropdown and filter the choices by typing. Can only be set to False if `allow_custom_value` is False.
            label: The label for this component. Appears above the component and is also used as the header if there are a table of examples for this component. If None and used in a `gr.Interface`, the label will be the name of the parameter this component is assigned to.
            info: additional component description.
            every: If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
            show_label: if True, will display label.
            container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.
            scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            interactive: if True, choices in this dropdown will be selectable; if False, selection will be disabled. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: If False, component will not be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
